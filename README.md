# Chaos To-Do List 🌀

**Protocol 404 Hackathon Project**  

A productivity app built for a broken system — your tasks are never safe. Shuffle, corrupt, or sabotage your to-dos and embrace chaos while still getting things done… kinda.  

---

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch
"Organized chaos, one task at a time."  
Your task list fights back — complete or fail, it’s up to entropy.  

---

## 🧠 Inspiration
In a world where systems break, we wanted a productivity tool that doesn’t just work, it **rebels**. The Chaos To-Do List forces creativity by making every task unpredictable.  

---

## ⚡ What it does
- **Shuffle tasks** automatically or manually  
- **Corrupt text** to make tasks confusing  
- **Random sabotage** events that delete or inject tasks  
- Adjustable **chaos intensity** to control entropy  
- Error overlay when the system “glitches”  

---

## 🛠 How we built it
- **React** for UI and state management  
- **TailwindCSS** for rapid styling and glitch effects  
- **Vite** for dev server and production build  
- **nanoID** for unique task IDs  
- Custom **chaos engine** for shuffle, corrupt, and sabotage logic  
- Local storage for persisting tasks  

---

## ⚔️ Challenges we ran into
- Making **chaos fun but not useless**  
- TailwindCSS **invalid class issues** during build  
- Timing and intervals for sabotage events  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Fully working **chaos engine**  
- Live **glitch animations** for header  
- Smooth, responsive UI with Tailwind  
- Persisting tasks even when sabotage strikes  

---

## 💡 What we learned
- How to **embrace unpredictability** in app behavior  
- Using **useEffect, useState, and useRef** for timed events  
- Handling **localStorage persistence** with React hooks  
- TailwindCSS troubleshooting in Vite projects  

---

## 🔮 What's next
- Add **undo for sabotage events**  
- Randomize **task colors** or styles for more visual chaos  
- Optionally **share chaotic lists** with friends
